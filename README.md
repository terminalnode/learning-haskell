# Learning Haskell
These are my notes and  exercises as I move through Christopher Allen and Julie Moronuki's excellent book [Haskell Programming from First Principles](http://haskellbook.com).

For each chapter I have a notes.md where I write down noteworthy information, an exercises.hs where I write down code examples and stuff like that, and a chapterExercises.hs where I do the final exercises.

There's a set of [99 Haskell problems](https://wiki.haskell.org/H-99:_Ninety-Nine_Haskell_Problems) over at the Haskell wiki.
